Roller is a game where the objective is to get to the end of a particular level.

As the player makes their way through the levels they will come across a slew of obstacles.
These obstacles will cause a player to lose health or die, restarting them at the beginning of the level.

Along the way the player can collect coins that serve as a health meter.
The health meter is seperated into sections that can be consumed to give the player a small boost of speed.

To move use the WASD keys, to jump press SPACE, and to boost press the CTRL key.

Will you be able to beat all of the levels?
